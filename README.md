#Portfolio-challenge

## Description 
I took on the challenge of creating a portfolio from scratch, only using Html and CSS. My goal of this challenge was to have a header, including an image of myself, functional links, and a contact section. Some of the challenges I faced was structuring my webpage to have images larger than others and correct navigations. I hope to become an expert in the future of CSS and HTML.
